## Data Sets
- US Census Population Estimates: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj/popest.html
- US Decennial Census: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census.html
- FEC Campaign Finance Data: https://www.fec.gov/data/

### Reasons for Choosing
We chose these because these data sets are of very high volume due to them coming directly from the federal government.
We intend to perform a retrospective study to analyze the different intersections of demographics (e.g., age, sex, location) how they relate to the funding and spending of different campaigns.
