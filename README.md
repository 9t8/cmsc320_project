We plan to use the Census Bureau's population estimates (https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj/popest.html) and decennial census (https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census.html), likely throught the `census` package (https://pypi.org/project/census/), and the FEC's campaign finance data (https://www.fec.gov/data/, https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/).

We chose these because these datasets are of very high volume due to them coming from the federal government. We intend to perform a retrospective study to analyze the different intersections of demographics (e.g., age, sex, location) how they relate to the funding and spending of different campaigns.
